## Original "keep" note

Two teams fight for something ("honor" - see below) 

One or more players is secretly a prophet (alternatively, is a time traveler from the future); they have secretly been assigned one or more (non-prophet, non-time-traveler) players who are the "saviors of the future" who will later bring peace between the two sides. The prophets' (time travelers') goal is to keep those players alive throughout the game. Unless *all* "savior" characters survive, the civilization/world is doomed. 

Every player (or some group of players? Best if "saviors" are included, but it shouldn't give away who they are) is assigned another player (usually or always on the other side?) for whom they must sacrifice their lives (if possible) if that player is in danger. 

Tri-colored "strength" tokens w/ weakness/resistance. *Defender* gets to pick which token with which to defend; 

"honor" acquired by killing - ultimate goal of each side 

"wounds"? 

Private team strategizing? 

Group fighting? Sacrifice...? 

Kill rate per fight between 1/3 and 1/5, maybe? Adjustable for different number of players or game time? 

Traitors: ensures that protecting a member of the other team doesn't mean they're a savior and the protector is a prophet
