## Design

* more traitors!
    * different "types" of traitors? "false prophet", "drunk brawler"
* Prophet pick who chosen one is? (how?)

## Known bugs

### Breaking

* Attacker assist can't join if missing *defense* color type

### Non-breaking

* 'targeted/initial' displayed _below_ player
* "Adding defenders/attackers to [attack]" is confusing, b/c "[attack]"
  formatting starts with "Attackers:"
* Assists are listed as "combatants", after primary combatant has already been
  listed
* Attack outcome is not clear (doesn't say whether attack or defense won)
